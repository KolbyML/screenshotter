# Screenshotter

**Screenshotter** is a simple desktop application that continuously captures screenshots of a selected window and copies them directly to your clipboard.  
You can configure the capture frequency (in seconds), making it easy to keep your clipboard up to date with the latest screenshot.

## ‚ú® Motivation

I built Screenshotter to streamline my Anki workflow.  
When creating cards, I wanted a quick way to grab images without the extra hassle of manually taking and importing screenshots each time.

Here‚Äôs how it integrates with [Yomitan](https://github.com/yomidevs/yomitan):

*My personal Yomitan settings.*

I also added a second button in Yomitan that uses `clipboard-image` (from Screenshotter) instead of Yomitan‚Äôs built-in `screenshot` feature:

## üõ† Development

To run Screenshotter in development mode:

```bash
deno task tauri dev
```

## Tauri Setup stuff

### Tauri + Vue + TypeScript

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 and TypeScript in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) + [Tauri](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tauri-apps.tauri-vscode) + [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)

### Type Support For `.vue` Imports in TS

Since TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports, they are shimmed to be a generic Vue component type by default. In most cases this is fine if you don't really care about component prop types outside of templates. However, if you wish to get actual prop types in `.vue` imports (for example to get props validation when using manual `h(...)` calls), you can enable Volar's Take Over mode by following these steps:

1. Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VS Code's command palette, look for `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, then right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`. By default, Take Over mode will enable itself if the default TypeScript extension is disabled.
2. Reload the VS Code window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.

You can learn more about Take Over mode [here](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471).

Make sure you have installed the prerequisites for your OS: https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/, then run:
  cd screenshotter
  deno install
  deno task tauri android init
